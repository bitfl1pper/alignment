# alignment

**This repository contains various implementations of sequence alignment algorithms in clojure.**

For educational use only. If you need to actually do sequence alignment, please use production ready software.

The goal here is to learn how the underlying algorithms work, optimization may come in the future.

*This is very early stage, so far only one algorithm is (partially) implemented, road map coming soon... I expect this repo to be developed on for quite some time*

## Usage

A more useful tutorial is hopefully coming soon. If you would actually like to use this software, you may want to first familiarize yourself with a lot of other stuff first. Failing that, please appreciate the succinctness and passive-aggression of this short tutorial.

[Update October 20] I hope you're having a nice day, I'm going to have more time this week to work on this. Maybe we'll get a tutorial/actual documentation/more algorithms implemented!
